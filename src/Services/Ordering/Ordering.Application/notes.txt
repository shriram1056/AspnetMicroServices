Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions


The main benefit of using a Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions is improved flexibility and maintainability. It allows you to switch or upgrade logging frameworks without making significant changes to your codebase. For example, if you initially use a logging library like Log4Net and later decide to switch to Serilog, you can easily do so by changing the configuration without modifying your code that uses the logging abstraction.
