we need a DTO object for commands and query as we want to seperate them. They are exactly same or slightly different from data model and Idk why this is a thing. So basically we map the DTO to  data model and vise-versa.

Mediator Pattern:

one mediator mediates between incoming requests, implementors of IRequest from MediatR, and sending them to correct IRequestHandler, again MediatR shit.

IRequesthandler has Handle method which handles the incoming method.


Request Pipeline:

Caller -> Request -> MediatR -> pre processor behavior -> Handler -> post processor behavior -> Response
