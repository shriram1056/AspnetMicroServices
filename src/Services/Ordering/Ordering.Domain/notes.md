Value Objects:

Value objects are objects that represent a concept or entity based solely on their attributes or values. They are typically immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. The equality of value objects is determined by the equality of their attribute values.


Identity:

Identity, in the context of software development, refers to the unique characteristic or identifier that distinguishes one object from another. It provides a way to differentiate objects even if their attributes are the same. Identity is typically represented by an identifier such as a unique ID, a primary key, or a combination of attributes that form a unique key.



What is Domain-Driven Design?


Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on building complex software systems by closely aligning the implementation with the business domain it represents. 

The main goals of Domain-Driven Design include:

1. Ubiquitous Language: The goal of ubiquitous language is to bridge the communication gap between the domain experts and the development team, ensuring a common understanding of the business domain and its concepts. Programmers play a crucial role in capturing the domain knowledge and translating it into a software model. They are responsible for creating the domain model (entities), which represents the business concepts, relationships, and behavior.

2. Domain Modeling: DDD encourages the creation of a domain model that represents the core concepts, relationships, and behavior of the business domain. The domain model captures the essential elements of the problem space and serves as a guide for designing the software solution.

3. Bounded Contexts: A bounded context is a well-defined boundary that encapsulates a specific part of the domain model along with its associated language, rules, and context. DDD recognizes that complex domains may have different contexts with their own models and constraints.
