Value Objects:

Value objects are objects that represent a concept or entity based solely on their attributes or values. They are typically immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. The equality of value objects is determined by the equality of their attribute values.


Identity:

Identity, in the context of software development, refers to the unique characteristic or identifier that distinguishes one object from another. It provides a way to differentiate objects even if their attributes are the same. Identity is typically represented by an identifier such as a unique ID, a primary key, or a combination of attributes that form a unique key.
